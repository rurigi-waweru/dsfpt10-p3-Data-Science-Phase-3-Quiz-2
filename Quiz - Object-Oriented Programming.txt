Quiz: Object-Oriented Programming

Question 1:

Which of the following is the correct way to instantiate the `Driver` class?

class Driver:
    def greeting(self):
	return "Hello, how are you today?"

(i) bill = Driver() 

(ii) bill.Driver() 

(iii) import Driver 

(iv) Driver.bill() 

(v) driver('bill')


Question 2:

When writing code, what statement can be used as a placeholder to prevent an indentation error?


(i) def

(ii) instance

(iii) class

(iv) pass

(v) break


Question 3:

In the following example, what is the expected output?

class Bike:
	def color(self):
		return "The bike is Red"
	
	def style(self):
		return "The bike is a Road bike"

my_new_bike = Bike()
my_new_bike.style()

(i) AttributeError: 'Bike' object has no attribute 'style'


(ii) ’The bike is Red’


(iii) There is no output


(iv) <__main__.Bike object at 0x7fdf900313a0>


(v) ’The bike is a Road bike’


Question 4:

In the following example, which of the following outputs can you expect?

class Cat:
	
	def meow():
		return "Meow, Purr!"

fifi = Cat()
fifi.meow()

(i) TypeError: meow() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given


(ii) ‘Meow, Purr!’


(iii) <bound method Cat.meow of <__main__.Cat object at 0x7fdf900313a0>>


(iv) AttributeError: 'Cat' object has no attribute 'meow'


(v) There is no output


Question 5:
