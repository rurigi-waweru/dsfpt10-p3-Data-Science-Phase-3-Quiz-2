    "\n",
    "(i) ✅ Correct: This is the standard syntax for creating an object (instance) of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) ❌ Incorrect: This would attempt to call a method named Driver on a variable bill, which is undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) ❌ Incorrect: import Driver is for importing a module, not instantiating a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) ❌ Incorrect: This tries to call a method bill() on the class Driver, which doesn’t exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "(v) ❌ Incorrect: driver('bill') implies driver is a callable (like a function or class), but it's undefined here, and Driver doesn’t take arguments in the constructor."

    "\n",
    "(i) def ❌ Incorrect: def is used to define a function, not to prevent indentation errors.\n",

    "(i) TypeError ✅ Correct: The method meow() is defined without a self parameter, which is required in instance methods. When calling fifi.meow(), Python automatically passes fifi as the first argument (i.e., self), causing the TypeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) 'Meow, Purr!' ❌ Incorrect: The function would work if it had a self parameter, but it doesn’t, leading to an error.\n",

    "(iii) <bound method Cat.meow of <__main__.Cat object at 0x7fdf900313a0>> ❌ Incorrect: This would happen if you accessed meow without calling it (e.g., fifi.meow), not when invoking it.\n",

    "(iv) AttributeError: 'Cat' object has no attribute 'meow' ❌ Incorrect: The meow method exists; the issue is with the incorrect method definition.\n",

    "\n",
    "(iii) Call a short script multiple times ✅ Correct: Functions allow you to define a block of code that can be called and executed multiple times, making the code more modular and reusable.\n",

    "(i) Break a program ❌ Incorrect: Functions themselves don't break a program; they help organize and structure code.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Create a GOTO statement ❌ Incorrect: Functions don’t create a GOTO statement, which is a separate control flow statement that is generally discouraged in modern programming due to its potential for creating spaghetti code.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) Set global variables ❌ Incorrect: Functions can access or modify global variables, but they don't inherently make it easier to set them. In fact, the use of global variables can often complicate code."
